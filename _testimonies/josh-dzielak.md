title: Community at heart
---

Frank, I admired your energy, sense of humor, and spirit in each of the communities we shared.
Tirelessly, you brought people and ideas together in ways that enriched us, while still offering
more of your time to mentor others. Your example will inspire us long into the future. Rest in peace, friend.
