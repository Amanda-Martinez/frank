If it's true that you are what you repeatedly do, Frank was empathetic, passionate, considerate, and extremely diligent. There was no slipping through the cracks with Frank, if you were talking to him,
he was fully present and you were heard loud and clear. He was great at viewing things through the lens of others, and he never lost site of how every decision we were making would affect real people.
He'd always give shoutouts to his coworkers, making sure they knew they were seen. I remember
early-on in my time at Forestry when I muttered something to him about how I didn't feel like I was getting much done. Frank wasn't having it, the next day he presented me with a thorough breakdown of some metrics
that showed how big of an impact I'd been having, and he shared them company-wide like a proud mother. He was completely selfless in that way, always lifting up others.

He taught me a lot about how to think critically and get to the heart of an issue. He was extremely blunt in the kindest way. I don't know he managed that, but he always made me think and he always made me laugh,
I'm not sure what else you could want in a coworker. I'll regret not soaking up more time with him, but I'm thankful for the moments we had.
