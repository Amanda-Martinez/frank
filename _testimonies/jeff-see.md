title: A fighter for users
---

Frank, if it's true that you are what you repeatedly do, you were empathetic, passionate, considerate, and extremely diligent.

There was no slipping through the cracks with you, you were fully present and those you spoke with were heard loud and clear. You were great at viewing things through the lens of others, you never lost site of how every decision we were making would affect real people. Fighting for users, as you'd say.

I remember early-on in my time at Forestry when I muttered something to you about how I didn't feel like I was getting much done. You weren't having it, the next day you presented me with a thorough breakdown of some metrics that showed how big of an impact I'd been having, and you shared them company-wide like a proud mother. You were completely selfless in that way, always lifting up others.

And you taught me a lot about how to think critically and get to the heart of an issue. You were extremely blunt in the kindest way. I don't know you managed that, but you always made me think and you always made me laugh, I'm not sure what else I could want in a coworker. I'll regret not soaking up more time with you, but I'm thankful for the moments we had.

To Frank's loved ones, please know that he was a cherished member of our team, and that you have my deepest sympathy for your loss. Thank you for sharing Frank with us.
